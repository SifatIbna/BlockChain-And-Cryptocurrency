# What is BlockChain? ü§î
The blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger that stores data such as transactions, and that is publicly shared across all the nodes of its network.

## What is Ledger? üìô
A ledger is a record-keeping book that stores all the transactions of a organization. \
The Block chain **LEDGER** is distributed. \

### What do I mean by BlockChain Ledger is Distributed? ü§ê
Lets say there's a centralized network and many nodes or computers or devices are connected to this network. So each of the nodes gets a copy of transactional history or copy of ledger in this blockchain. So this Blockchain network being distributed also means that the Blockchain is **Decentralized**.

## What is Centralized or Decentralized Model? ü§ì
| Centralized | Decentralized |
--------------|----------------
|One Entity records the data|Everyone records the data|
|The Central Entity has a lot of power|Everyone has equal power|
|Full authority to fine or reward|Fair and Transparent System|
|Complete trust with the entity|Trustless|

# **So What we know this Far of our discussion?**

- [x] What is Blockchain
- [x] What is Ledger in Blockchain
- [x] What is Centralized and Decentralized System
- [x] Why we should trust the decentralized System
- [ ] Why use Blockchain 
But the real question is *Why We should use Blockchain?*

## Why use the Blockchain?
- Decentralized leads to a trustless system
- No middle men and no fees
- Highly secure and no central point of failure
- Dependable data
