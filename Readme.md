# What is BlockChain? ü§î
The blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger that stores data such as transactions, and that is publicly shared across all the nodes of its network.

## What is Ledger? üìô
A ledger is a record-keeping book that stores all the transactions of a organization. \
The Block chain **LEDGER** is distributed.

### What do I mean by BlockChain Ledger is Distributed? ü§ê
Lets say there's a centralized network and many nodes or computers or devices are connected to this network. So each of the nodes gets a copy of transactional history or copy of ledger in this blockchain. So this Blockchain network being distributed also means that the Blockchain is **Decentralized**.

## What is Centralized or Decentralized Model? ü§ì
| Centralized | Decentralized |
--------------|----------------
|One Entity records the data|Everyone records the data|
|The Central Entity has a lot of power|Everyone has equal power|
|Full authority to fine or reward|Fair and Transparent System|
|Complete trust with the entity|Trustless|

# **So What we know this Far of our discussion?**

- [x] What is Blockchain
- [x] What is Ledger in Blockchain
- [x] What is Centralized and Decentralized System
- [x] Why we should trust the decentralized System
- [ ] Why use Blockchain 
But the real question is *Why We should use Blockchain?*

## Why use the Blockchain?
- Decentralized leads to a trustless system
- No middle men and no fees
- Highly secure and no central point of failure
- Dependable data

# Cryptocurrency
Blockchain technologies and cryptocurrecies so frequently appear in the same sentence that the concepts have almost become synonymous in tech cultue. \
So Cryptocurrecy do leverage the blockchain but a cryotocurrecy is its own technology that only has a blockchain as one piece in its puzzle. \
A cryptocurrecy itself
- A cryptocurrency is a digital medium of exchange
- It has three main features: a secure blockchain, wallets, and mining.

## What do I mean by Cryptocurrecy leverages BlockChain?
Cryptocurrecy leverages blockchain technology it does so in order to keeps a public database of transactions that everyone  has access to. So the question is \
``How is this Secure?`` \
As it is publicly avaiable couldn't someone modify the system and transfer more currecy to themselves.

### Cryptography
To prevent this problem cryptocurrency uses cryptography to add a layer of security to the blockchain. With Cryptography the blockchain uses a technique of using algorithms to obscure data into hidden, or in other words, cryptic messages which give the blockchain the ability to generate **digital signatures** for individuals in the network.

<p>
    So we learned that

- [x] using blockchain is secure
- [x] uses cryptography to prevent temparing
- [x] uses cryptography to generate digital signatures

</p>

### Digital Signatures
Uses Public and Private key pair to ensure security. \
A user uses private to decrypt the message or the transaction and on the other side the receiver uses the public key to decrypt the transaction. \
Using this method ensures high security to the cryptocurrecy system.
